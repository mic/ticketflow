# Intent
The intent of this project is foremost to playaround with clojure-script and while learning it, building a system that helps me with creating and managing tickets in an agile software development project.   

# About TicketFlow
TicketFlow helps creating and mainting tickets used in an agile software development process for a regulated software. It provides an interface to communicate with different llms to create workflow agents that manage and create tickets. The tickets that types that are currently supported are:
    
- ~~ Problem Report Tickets ~~
- ~~ Product Change Requests ~~
- ~~ Software System Requirements ~~
- ~~ Opportunities ~~
- ~~ Bug Tickets ~~
- ~~ Root Cause Analysis ~~
- ~~ User Stories ~~
- ~~ Action Plans ~~
- ~~ Test plans in Gherkin ~~

Ticketflow manages different template types for those tickets. In addition TicketFlow has access to exiting tickets of various types in the ticketing system and uses this content to create better new tickets and helps finding requirements that are already created.
